    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was approaching <abbr title="Water Station 7">WS7</abbr> (~60km) when it happened. I felt a small tingling sensation at the back of head which evolved to stinging pain.</p>

    <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An insect was trying to eat me for dinner!</p>

    <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I instinctively started slapping the back of my head to get rid of it. The pain subsided &amp; I continued on with my journey.</p>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, I discovered that a swelling the size of a <abbr title="A tropical fruit">lychee</abbr> - at the back of my head - was a souvenir from that insect.<i class="icon-fire"></i>
    </p>


    <h1>Motivation</h1>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The journey that I referred to above is a 100 km single stage footrace around the hillsides surrounding Kundasang &amp; Ranau; all under the shadow of Mount Kinabalu. One of the reasons that I signed up for the race was because I wanted the two <abbr title="Ultra-trail du Mont-Blanc">UTMB</abbr> points on offer.<i class="icon-gift"></i></p> 

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two weeks earlier (31st August 2012), I participated in the 100 km <abbr title="Courmayeur Champex Chamonix">CCC</abbr> but just as it was in the 2011th edition, the course had to be truncated due to <a href="http://goo.gl/Nf9ur" target="_blank" title="Youtube video at Grand col ferret in atrocious weather at CCC 2012">bad weather</a>. Thus, <a href="http://www.sabahadventurechallenge.com/ultra/" target="_blank">tmbt</a> offered me another chance to finally nail the full 100 km distance.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The race briefing helped me to come up with these 4 coping strategies:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Don't injure yourself</li>
      <li>Keep your shoes dry</li>
      <li>Stay positive even if it hurts</li>
      <li>Don't get lost</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this race report, I will describe the race in short vignettes organized around 6 themes. <i class="icon-th"></i>
    </p>

    <h2>Nature</h2>

    <blockquote>
    <p style="font-style: italic;">After you have exhausted what there is in business, politics, or conviviality, and so on - have found that none of these finally satisfying, or permanently new - what remains ?  Nature remains.</p>
    <small>Walt Whitman</small> 
    </blockquote>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Runners enjoyed mostly good weather on race day. In perfect conditions, I enjoyed negotiating the vegetable farms in the early kilometres. I got sprayed in the face by strategically placed water sprinklers, jumped over little streams, clambered over rocks, &amp; breathed in fresh mountain air amongst others.</p>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The terrain was mixed: a little bit of tarred roads, unpaved roads, jungle trails, semi-completed roads, roads fit only for four-wheel drive vehicles, soft-soiled single-track roads, etc. I had a lot of problems with the gravel roads; my feet didn't like them. After 50 kms, even walking was painful.<i class="icon-thumbs-down"></i> 
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is disheartening to see runners litter, but I did see it with my own eyes. If it was by accident, it is forgivable. The <abbr title="Ultra-trail du Mont-Blanc">UTMB</abbr> organizer was so angry with the littering that happened this year that it published a scathing attack &amp; <a href="http://ultratrailmb.com/page/196/Des%20porcs%20et%20des%20Mufles.html" target="_blank">branded</a> the guilty trailrunners <strong>pigs</strong>!
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think I may have one solution to alleviate the problem: if you see a fellow runner littering, pick up the garbage and chase after him/her and politely say: "<em>Excuse me, you dropped this</em>", while showing them the detritus. Slowly, they will get the message if this happens often enough.

</p>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some runners, it was nerve-wracking to have to run over roads with risks of landslides. I was a bit nonchalant about it. In the papers from that weekend, I read about families living in Tamparuli (Sabah) whose houses were threatened by landslides. They worry for their safety every day. We runners just need to be worried about a kilometre-or-so stretch of road.

</p>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the race course, I encountered dogs, cats, cows, dogs, goats, dogs, small rodents, a stick insect, rats, mosquitoes, and dogs. As someone who has been attacked three times by dogs, I was afraid of them. Sometimes the owner would come out from his house to rein in his pets. At other times, I just walked past forcefully without looking at them.
    </p>


    <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the night descent from WS9 to WS10, I developed a strategy to catch my breath. I placed my water bottle on the ground in front of me (<strong>note to self</strong>: <em>use walking poles for my next ultra</em>). With one hand resting on the bottle, I counted from 1 to 10 while I took deep breaths. On one occasion, my headlamp captured an ant trail as depicted below.</p>

<p>

}
?>
</p>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ants were oblivious to the light shining on them and then I suddenly remembered reading that ants have poor eyesight but use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pheromone" target="_blank" title="wikipedia">pheromones</a> to navigate.</p>


    <h2>Solitude</h2>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first 50 kms, I always had some runners within sight. As day turned into night <i class="icon-adjust"></i>, I found myself alone on the race course. 
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was disconcerting for me as I generally use the presence of other runners to confirm that I'm not lost. If my memory serves me right, I was virtually alone during the trek from WS9 (~75 km) to WS11 (~87 km). <i class="icon-map-marker"></i>
    </p>
    <blockquote><p style="font-style: italic;">I think I'd like to tell them only this, to know how to find themselves more often alone - to enjoy being alone with themselves more frequently. I think the tragedy of today's youth is that they try to unite on the basis some noisy events, a couple even violent, and this desire to unite in order not not to be alone is an unpleasant condition, from my point of view. I think a person needs to learn from childhood to find himself alone.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After WS11, I followed a group of runners to the finish line.</p>


    <h2>Hills</h2>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was my favorite part of the race because runners were totally shielded from car or human traffic. It's just you against the hill. <i class="icon-arrow-up"></i></p>

    <h4>After WS4 (~37 km)</h4>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a jungle trail and some parts had knee-high grass. Extra care was required to avoid getting scraped by the <em>daun gatal</em> (nettles) lining the route (<strong>note to self</strong>: wear <em>chaussette longue</em> next time). I didn't encounter any snakes.
    </p>

    <h4>55K to WS7(60 km)</h4>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A runner was so impressed with the grade of the climb that he took pictures of it. I'm not sure if it was a 45% grade slope but it was close in some parts. This was the first of many hills that made me question the sanity of their architects.
    </p>

    <h4>WS8(65 km) to WS9 (~75 km)</h4>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After signing off my name at the <em>Kampung Karanaan</em> checkpoint, a woman asked me from her porch - "<em>Berani tak masuk hutan gelap</em> ?" (forgive me for my broken Malay but she asked if I'm brave enough to enter the forest in the dark). I answered yes and started the climb.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I huffed and puffed up the hill and suddenly heard explosions behind me. They were releasing fireworks to commemorate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysia_Day" title="wikipedia" target="_blank">Malaysia Day</a>.</p>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every now and then, I would stop climbing &amp; gazed up at the cloudless night sky. The stars were out in force that night. <i class="icon-asterisk"></i>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was one of the longest segment of the course (in between aid stations) which tested my patience &amp; my hunger pangs coupled with my exhaustion made things worse. I was down to my last drop of water when I arrived at WS9.
    </p>

    <h2>Hunger</h2>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my backpack, I carried 1 energy gel, 2 muesli bars and a dozen Iranian dates. But during the 2nd 50km, I could only force myself to swallow the dates. I had no appetite for the gels or muesli bars. Instead, I was craving for salty foods. After WS9, if you had given me a cup of seawater, I would have downed it in one shot.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an easy explanation for my aversion to sweet things: I am a salty sweater &amp; I sweat a lot. I believe that I was already low on sodium when I arrived at WS6 (50 km). I felt dizzy and decided to have my blood pressure checked out by the medical team after ingesting some porridge. But I forgot to do that.
    </p>

    <p style="margin 0 auto; text-align: center;">
    <button class="btn btn-large btn-primary btn-danger" type="button">
    <i class="icon-warning-sign"></i>
    Low on sodium! Please replenish ASAP!</button>
    </p>

    <p class="lead">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a precedent to my low sodium situation. At the Boston marathon in April 2012, I had to be wheelchaired into the medical tent &amp; almost passed out due to hypotension (low blood pressure). They measured it at 70/60. During the race, I rejected the sweet gatorade drink and was severely dehydrated as a result.</p>


    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the descent to WS11, my stomach felt like it was being tied in knots. Luckily for me, the official at WS11 gave me a box of rice with scrambled eggs. Real food never tasted so good. In future ultras; I am going to pack salty Malaysian dishes in small sachets &amp; carry them instead of gels or energy bars. 
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>2x sachets of fried rice with MSG.</li>
      <li>1x sachet of salty <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Char_kway_teow" title="wikipedia" target="_blank">Char Kuew Teow</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Resilience</h2>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've learnt that one cannot let negative thoughts crowd your mind when you're on a journey like a 100 km ultramarathon. Actually, you only need a little nudge to stay optimistic.
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Exhibit A</strong>: Runner 415 was suffering from cramps on the climb up from WS4. When I passed him, he was telling me that he cannot finish the 100 km in his current state. I turned to him and said, "<em>just take your time and bring yourself to the 50 km checkpoint. Rest and have something to eat then only decide on whether you want to quit there</em>". Remarkably he managed to finish the 100 km in 17th place. <i class="icon-leaf"></i>
    </p>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for me, I never doubted my will power to complete the race. But it was nice to get an SMS from a 50 km runner acquaintance, Faisal (whose mobile number is saved as <em>Dvilla JB couple</em> in my phone), asking me how I was during my ascent to WS8. That SMS exchange was a mini life-saver. <i class="icon-ok"></i>

    <p class="lead">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firstly, I believed I had treated tmbt 100km purely as a means to an end; the end being the 2 UTMB points. I never imagined that the course promised an elevation gain of 4350m. In my opinion, running tmbt was like running another CCC two weeks later. It deserves at least 2.5 UTMB points or more. Thus the <strong>b</strong> in <strong>tmbt</strong> should be rebranded <em>brutal and beautiful</em>.
